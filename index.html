        <p>Nigeria is a vibrant and diverse country located in West Africa, known as the most populous nation on the
            continent. It
            is rich in culture, history, and natural resources, with over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages
            spoken. The
            country is famous for its lively music, film industry (Nollywood), and delicious cuisine. Major cities like
            Lagos,
            Abuja, and Port Harcourt showcase Nigeria’s growing economy and urban energy, while its landscapes range
            from tropical
            rainforests and savannas to the Niger River and Atlantic coastline. Nigeria is often called the “Giant of
            Africa” for
            its influence across politics, culture, and business.
